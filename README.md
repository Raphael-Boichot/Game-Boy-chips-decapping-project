# Game-Boy-chips-decapping-project

**A database of microscopic images of decapped (or not) chips from Game Boy cartridges and some Chinese bootlegs.**

**Decapping and images made by [Raphaël BOICHOT](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot), most of the chips donated by [Dorian](https://github.com/dori4n), others from the author personnal collection and from [Rafael ZENARO](https://github.com/zenaro147). Please credit authors.**

The silicon dies were extracted from epoxy matrix by dipping chips in boiling 70% nitric acid until no red fumes degases from the beaker. The black residuals at the end of reaction were removed with 1-2 minutes treatment in water with ultrasonic bath. After rincing with lot of deionized water, dies were finally gently cleaned with isopropanol and a cotton bud to remove any dust and residue before imaging with a very expensive and powerfull microscope.

I definitely do not recommend doing the process if you are not a skilled chemist (or a skilled [Furrtek](https://github.com/furrtek)). You will probably need some safety equipment (fumehood and individual protection against strong acids) but who cares. Doing the process bare hand in a backyard with a cooking plate is still a possible option if you like the thrill of danger. Also, depending on which happy democraty you belong to, just attempting to buy 70% nitric acid will introduce you into some embarrassing government databases.

Images were taken with a magnification of x250 or x500 (depending on the total surface of the chip). Higher magnifications of some zones can be obtained on request (dies are still stored by the author). 

To complete this project, some interesting readings about the MBCs can be found into the [Brendan's Website](https://b13rg.github.io/Gameboy-MBC-Analysis/), into the [Gekkio database](https://gbhwdb.gekkio.fi/cartridges/) and into the [gbdev wiki](https://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Memory_Bank_Controllers).

# Game Boy Camera MAC-GBD mapper
Camera CE10251329, PCB revision 11 - Unknown manufacturer - Chip marking: **MAC-GBD Nintendo 9815 SA** [High resolution here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUm43i4zzt71fiRKpbipy4eYC-yVmNwh/view?usp=sharing). The ADC part of the MAC-GBD is probably copied/inspired from a MAX153 as Mitsubishi refered to the MAX153 as a fast-enough converter for the M64282FP artificial retina.

The N.C. pin on the left side was probably intended to trigger the TADD pin of a M64283FP, successor of the M64282FP used with the camera. This pin is always high when camera is on and seems not connected to any logic. The current sensor does not need this extra trigger (the corresponding pin, TSW, is not connected on the M64282FP). The N.C. pin on the upper side is probably a RAM_CE1, seeing the proximity with RAM_CE2. Surprisingly, GND pins on the right side are mostly regular logic pins just set to ground whatever the manner. They may have been prepared/reserved for addressing bigger ram/rom.
