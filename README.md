# Game-Boy-chips-decapping-project
A database of microscopic images of decapped (or not) chips from Game Boy cartridges.

The silicon dies were extracted from epoxy matrix with 70% nitric acid heated at 250°C. The mineral carbon residuals were removed with rapid bath in nitro-chromic acid at 200-250°C. After rincing with deionized water, dies were finally gently cleaned with isopropanol and a cotton bud to remove any dust and residue before imaging with professionnal equipment.

I definitely do not recommend doing the process if you are not a skilled chemist with access to all necessary safety equipment (fumehood and individual protection against strong acids). Chromic acid derivatives are highly carcinogenic / environmentally unfriendly and any residual must be disposed in hazardous chemical waste containers.

Images were taken with a magnification of x250 or x500 by default (depends on the total surface of the chip). Higher magnifications of some zones can be obtained on request.
