# Game-Boy-chips-decapping-project
A database of microscopic images of decapped chips from Game Boy cartridges

The silicon dies were extracted from epoxy matrix with 70% nitric acid heated at 250°C. The mineral carbon residuals were removed with nitro-chromic acid at 200-250°C. After rincing with deionized water, dies were finally gently cleaned with isopropanol and a nonwoven cotton fabric to remove any dust. I defintely do not recommend doing the process if you are not a skilled chemist with access to all necessary safety equipment (fumehood and individual protection against strong acids). 

Images were taken with a magnification of x250 by default (may be more to reveal some details).
