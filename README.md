# Game-Boy-chips-decapping-project

**A database of microscopic images of decapped (or not) chips from Game Boy cartridges.**

**Please credit, these images are original.**

The silicon dies were extracted from epoxy matrix by dipping chips in 70% nitric acid heated at 200-250°C until no red fumes degases from the beaker. The mineral carbon residuals were possibly removed with rapid bath in nitro-chromic acid at 200-250°C (not mandatory, very aggressive mixture). After rincing with lot of deionized water, dies were finally gently cleaned with isopropanol and a cotton bud to remove any dust and residue before imaging with professional equipment.

I definitely do not recommend doing the process if you are not a skilled chemist (or Furrtek). You will probably need some safety equipment (fumehood and individual protection against strong acids). Chromic acid derivatives are highly carcinogenic/environmentally unfriendly/nasty and any residual must be disposed in hazardous chemical waste containers. Doing the process bare hand in a backyard with a cooking plate is still a possible option if you like the thrill of danger. Depending on your country, just attempting to buy 70% nitric acid will introduce you to nice government databases too.

Images were taken with a magnification of x250 or x500 (depending on the total surface of the chip). Higher magnifications of some zones can be obtained on request (dies are still stored by the author).
