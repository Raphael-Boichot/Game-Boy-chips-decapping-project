# Game-Boy-chips-decapping-project

**A database of microscopic images of decapped (or not) chips from Game Boy cartridges and some Chinese bootlegs.**

**Decapping and images made by [Raphaël BOICHOT](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot), most of the chips donated by [Dorian](https://github.com/dori4n), others from the author personnal collection. Please credit authors.**

The silicon dies were extracted from epoxy matrix by dipping chips in boiling 70% nitric acid until no red fumes degases from the beaker. The black residuals at the end of reaction were removed with 1-2 minutes treatment in water with ultrasonic bath. After rincing with lot of deionized water, dies were finally gently cleaned with isopropanol and a cotton bud to remove any dust and residue before imaging with professional equipment.

I definitely do not recommend doing the process if you are not a skilled chemist (or a skilled [Furrtek](https://github.com/furrtek)). You will probably need some safety equipment (fumehood and individual protection against strong acids). Doing the process bare hand in a backyard with a cooking plate is still a possible option if you like the thrill of danger. Also, depending on which happy democraty you belong to, just attempting to buy 70% nitric acid will introduce you into some embarrassing government databases.

Images were taken with a magnification of x250 or x500 (depending on the total surface of the chip). Higher magnifications of some zones can be obtained on request (dies are still stored by the author).
